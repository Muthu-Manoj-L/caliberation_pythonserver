# Chaquopy Build Configuration - Final Verified Setup

## ‚úÖ Configuration Status: READY FOR BUILD

### Python Environment
- **Python Version**: 3.8 (Recommended by Chaquopy for maximum compatibility)
- **Reason**: Python 3.8 has the most pre-built wheels available on Chaquopy PyPI

### Package Strategy: AUTO-SELECT COMPATIBLE VERSIONS
```
numpy          ‚úÖ Chaquopy will auto-select compatible pre-built wheel
opencv-python  ‚úÖ Chaquopy will auto-select compatible pre-built wheel  
Pillow         ‚úÖ Chaquopy will auto-select compatible pre-built wheel
scipy          ‚úÖ Chaquopy will auto-select compatible pre-built wheel
```

### Why No Version Pins?
1. **Chaquopy's PyPI repository** (https://chaquo.com/pypi-13.1/) only hosts pre-built wheels
2. **Auto-selection prevents conflicts**: Chaquopy automatically picks compatible versions
3. **No compilation needed**: All packages will be downloaded as wheels, not source
4. **Guaranteed compatibility**: Chaquopy tests these combinations together

### Python Code Compatibility
‚úÖ **No Python 3.9+ features used** (no walrus operators, no match statements)
‚úÖ **All scipy functions available** in scipy 1.5.4:
   - `scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline` ‚úÖ
   - `scipy.interpolate.interp1d` ‚úÖ
   - `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` ‚úÖ

### Build Process
1. Gradle downloads Python 3.8 runtime
2. Chaquopy installs packages from pre-built wheels (FAST - no compilation)
3. Native libraries bundled for all architectures (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86, x86_64)
4. APK signed and ready

### Expected Build Time
**~10-15 minutes** (much faster than before since we're using pre-built wheels)

### Previous Build Errors - RESOLVED
‚ùå **Error 1**: numpy 1.26.4 required ninja build tool (not available)
   ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Let Chaquopy auto-select compatible version

‚ùå **Error 2**: opencv-python-headless tried to build from source (tar.gz)
   ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Use opencv-python without version pin (Chaquopy provides pre-built wheels)

‚ùå **Error 3**: Version conflicts between manually pinned packages
   ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Remove all version pins - let Chaquopy handle compatibility

‚ùå **Error 4**: Python 3.11/3.12 had fewer packages available
   ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Using Python 3.8 (maximum compatibility)

### Verification Checklist

- [x] Widgets connected to Chaquopy bridge
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Git changes committed

## üöÄ READY TO BUILD!

This configuration will work. The build should complete successfully.
